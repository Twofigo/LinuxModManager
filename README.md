# LinuxModManager

**What is a mod manager?**
It's a tool that merges folders with an overwrite policy. That's it!

Linux has symlinks, so 90% of the work is done, i just need a script.

I wrote it in python over an evening so i could play StardewValley. I'll expand it and port it to rust or somehting when i feel like it.

read the code for avaliable commands.
